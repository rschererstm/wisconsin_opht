This notebook aims to demonstrate my bridge knowledge between Ophthalmology and Computer Vision.  The software sample apply filters to improve ophthalmological images, and another code analyzes medical texts. The codes are mere prototypes without clinical validation.

# Imaging Filters
An image filter is a technique through which size, colors, shading and other characteristics of an image are altered.

## Imaging Filters applied to Medical images
Image filtering techniques have numerous potential applications in biomedical imaging and image processing. The design of filters largely depends on the a priori, knowledge about the type of noise corrupting the image. This makes the standard filters application specific.

## Imaging Filters and Ophthalmology
Ophthalmology has used image filters since its inception.
From the cobalt blue filter in slit lamps to the modern noise reduction techniques in OCT.
The need to observe the ocular anatomy through structures that are not always transparent makes these techniques essential.

## This notebook
In this notebook, the CLAHE and RED FREE filters are demonstrated, as well as a brightness optimization filter with Deep Learning.
